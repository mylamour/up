  "ai_analysis": "I'll analyze this document on Git strategies for AI-driven \"vibe coding\" development.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n1. **Vibe Coding Paradigm** - Development where intent orchestration replaces manual coding; developer acts as architect directing AI builders\n\n2. **Pure vs Responsible Vibe Coding** - Pure is exploratory/rapid prototyping; Responsible maintains code ownership with rigorous review\n\n3. **The \"70% Problem\"** - AI gets you 70% there instantly, but final 30% of integration/debugging takes exponentially longer\n\n4. **\"Paint Sprayer\" Effect** - AI generates code as \"black boxes\" vs the \"white box\" understanding of manual coding\n\n5. **Version Loop Tightening** - Traditional \"Code \u2192 Test \u2192 Commit\" becomes \"Prompt \u2192 Generate \u2192 Visual Diff \u2192 Reset/Commit\"\n\n6. **Git as \"Ripcord\"** - Commit before every significant prompt; `git reset --hard` immediately on flawed generation\n\n7. **Provenance Obscurity** - `git blame` shows who prompted, but the reasoning/prompt context is lost\n\n8. **Contextual Overwrite Risk** - AI may delete critical edge-case handling outside its context window\n\n## Patterns\n\n| Pattern | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Commit-Before-Prompt** | Always commit clean state before AI generation |\n| **Hard Reset Recovery** | Reset immediately on bad generation vs \"prompting out\" |\n| **Git Worktrees** | Parallel development with multiple AI agents |\n| **Specification-Driven** | Tools like Copilot Workspace use specs before code |\n| **Composer Model** | IDE-native AI editing multiple files simultaneously |\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Never \"prompt your way out\"** of bad generation - reset and refine the prompt instead\n2. **Use `.cursorrules`** (or equivalent) as a gatekeeper for AI behavior\n3. **Review every diff** in responsible mode - treat AI as pair programmer, not autonomous agent\n4. **Commit atomically** - small, logical commits for easier bisect debugging\n5. **Preserve prompt context** - document the \"why\" alongside commits for future debugging\n6. **Avoid \"Apply All\" blindly** - scrutinize multi-file changes before accepting\n7. **Use worktrees for parallel agents** - prevents agents from overwriting each other\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### For up-cli\n\n1. **Add pre-prompt checkpoint command** - Auto-commit or stash before AI operations\n2. **Prompt logging** - Store prompts alongside commits for provenance\n3. **Worktree orchestration** - Manage parallel agent branches with automatic merge conflict detection\n4. **\"Doom loop\" detection** - Warn when multiple failed prompts suggest need for reset\n5. **Diff review workflow** - Integrate visual diff step before accepting AI changes\n6. **Context budget awareness** - Track AI context window usage to prevent contextual overwrite\n\n### Workflow Integration\n\n```\n# Proposed vibe coding safety loop\n1. git commit -m \"checkpoint: before AI prompt\"\n2. Run AI generation\n3. Review diff (mandatory)\n4. Accept \u2192 commit with prompt context\n   OR Reject \u2192 git reset --hard HEAD\n```"
